            In order to work effectively as a team and build a sense of psychological safety, it is important that you know one
            another on a bit of a personal level. This is why as your first team assignment we are having you conduct a group bonding activity of your choice. There are
            no strict requirements for what this activity has to be, and it doesn't have a required length of time, but we recommend
            at least an hour or so. The goal of this assignment is for it to be fun, relaxed, and lighthearted, so don't stress
            about the details too much.
